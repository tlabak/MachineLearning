def hello_world():
    """
    In this and future coding assignments, everywhere you see a `raise
    NotImplementedError` you should delete it and write code specified by the
    documentation. There will be at least one test case in the `tests/`
    directory that will check to see whether your implementation provides
    the expected behavior.

    When you run `python -m pytest`, the autograder will print out
    which tests you pass or fail. You should run this often, it will
    simply output `NotImplementedError` for the tests you haven't
    started working on. If you want to check a single test case,
    you can run e.g., `python -m pytest -k test_hello_world`.

    For this test, you should just return the text "Hello, world!"

    Args: None
    Returns: "Hello, world!"
